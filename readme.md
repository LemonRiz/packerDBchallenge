Instructions
For the challenge we would like you to create a Packer file that create us an AMI that is provisioned for MongoDB. We don’t require you to connect the App at the moment but we should like to see a working machine that has a Mongo shell running inside. (Ideally this can be a screen recording).
You have the starter code above and there is a the Packer file missing. Complete the code needed to create the MongoDB AMI. Deliverables below.

1. Repo on GitHub with Code and README.md
2. Complete Packer file to configure MongoDB
3. An instance created on AWS (Turned off when not using)
4. A screen recording and README explaining what the repo does and showcasing your work
   
To test the MongoDB you will need to SSH into the machine so don’t forget your .pem file. Run mongosh on your machine to show the configuration with Packer has been successful.
