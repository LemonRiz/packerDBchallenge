MongoDB Packer Challenge

Modified a Packer.json file with configuration that allows me to build an AMI on AWS.

I can launch the instance on AWS, and this starts running an Ubuntu virtual machine. 

Then, I SSH into the newly created virtual machine and run the Mongosh command to allow me database access.

I then run 'show dbs' as a command to list the available DBs
